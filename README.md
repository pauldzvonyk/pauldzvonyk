- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul Dzvonyk, python developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as freelance, creating websites for my clients as well as improving my scripting skills on Codewars & Leetcode.
- 👀 I’m looking forward to collaborate and contribute to database and backend projects.
- 💞️ Check-out my public repositories, I would highly recommend my latest Organizer repo, as it features a really interesting ideas and original approach to everyday mundane chores, making our life more enjoyable. There are also some automation projects, booking engine logic as well as GUI interfaces that you can use for your own projects. I’m looking forward to hear what you think. 
- 📫 You can reach me on my linkedin account: www.linkedin.com/in/paul-dzvonyk
- ⚡ Fun fact: you can text me on Chess.com if you're up for a quick blitz.
